# Java Coursework Compilation

##Description

This is a compilation of data structures, algorithms, and other utilities, written in java, that was developed throughout my coursework. I frequently reference this material to refresh my algorithms or when I find use cases in the code I write day to day. The repository is broken into sections based upon data structure or use case.
